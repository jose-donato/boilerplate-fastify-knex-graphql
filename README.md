# ðŸš€ Boilerplate for backend with performance in mind (fastify, knex and GraphQL) 

## Technologies used:
1. [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/): Fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js
2. [Knex](http://knexjs.org/): A query builder for PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite3, designed to be flexible, portable, and fun to use.
3. [Fastify-gql](https://github.com/mcollina/fastify-gql): Fastify barebone GraphQL adapter

## Features
This boilerplate includes:
* Schema (in migrations folder) for creating one table of people with columns: name, email and phone
* Endpoint for graphiql in [http://localhost:3000/graphiql](http://localhost:3000/graphiql)
* GraphQL resolvers to get one person or people from database and adding new people
* Normal rest endpoints for the same purpose (code in src/index.js)

Note that if you don't want to use GraphQL I have created a branch named `no-graphql` with the version without it.


## Usage
1. Clone repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jose-donato/boilerplate-fastify-knex-graphql.git && cd boilerplate-fastify-knex-graphql
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
$ npm install
```
3. Create database in case you are using pg and configure `.env` file (see below)

4. Run latest knex migrations (create tables)
```bash
$ npm run knex:migrate
```
5. Seed database (insert data in tables)
```bash
npm run knex:seed
```
6. Run server
```bash
$ npm run start
```

I use dotenv for loading environment variables, below there is an example of `.env` file that should be in root folder:
```txt
DBUSERNAME="postgres"
DBPASSWORD="postgres"
DBHOST="localhost"
DBPORT="5432"
DBNAME="boilerplate-db"
```

## Directory structure
```txt
|   knexfile.js       knex.js: config file
|   migrations/       GraphQL: schemas for knex.js (where you create tables)
|   |   +---people.js
